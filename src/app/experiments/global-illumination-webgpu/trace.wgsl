// One frame of the building, as a compute shader: a camera ray, the sun, a
// bounce path of one or two hops per pixel and a march through the sunlit
// air, each blended into the running mean of every frame before it. The
// WebGL page's trace.frag, with the four render targets turned into four
// storage textures written per invocation.
//
// The bounce is kept apart from the rest. It is the noisy, costly part, and
// it is smooth: when the camera moves it is carried over from last frame and
// only traced where something new comes into view. Everything sharp — the
// sun, its shadows, the surfaces' colours — is cheap, so it is simply traced
// again, and stays crisp however far the camera swings.
//
// With the probe volume, the bounce isn't traced per pixel at all: it's read
// from the probes around each surface, which probe.wgsl keeps up to date.
//
// The chrome torus bounces nothing matte; it mirrors. What it shows depends on
// where it's seen from, so it all goes with the sharp, cheap part — traced
// fresh each frame — and none of it with the bounce carried across moves.
//
// While the plus turns, its shadow and its bounce move. The bounce near it
// then keeps only a short running mean, carried over by where each point was
// — on the plus, where it was before it turned — and the denoiser after this
// pass smooths what that leaves noisy (paths.wgsl's memory()).
//
// With the half-resolution bounce, this pass leaves the path tracer's bounce
// alone: bounce.wgsl traces it at a quarter of the pixels, and upsample.wgsl
// spreads it back over every pixel, edge by edge.
//
// Pixels run bottom-up, as gl_FragCoord did, so all the screen maths carries
// over unchanged; the display pass turns the picture the right way up.

// Frame comes from frame.wgsl, the bounce rays from paths.wgsl, joined ahead of this.
